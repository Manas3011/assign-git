What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
The gitignore file is basically the file which is used for mentioning 
the list of files or file patterns that needs to be ignored while the 
project is being committed to the remote repository. These files are 
typically, not useful for other developers and are primarily the 
temporary files that IDE creates. For a Java project it should include 
*.class,*.jar,*.war,*.ear,*.log,*.zip,*.tar.gz,*.rar file patterns.
What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Fast-forward in git is normally the case when we merge the branch that 
is ahead of the checkout branch. Since there are no different commits 
to the remote other than the checkout branch so git does a fast forward
for the push and directly merges the new branch to the remote branch.
Why should you have different branches?
When multiple developers work on different items its considered best 
practice to have different branches for each of the developer so that 
they can test their local codebase without being bothered about the 
changes from the others and without braking the masters branch. Further 
different branches also allow the project to restrict the control to 
push into the master or the release branches only to senior developers 
without taking away the opportunity from other developers to utilize the 
source control features and its benefits.
In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
In a project there can be several remote repositories depending on the 
developerâ€™s criteria to segregate tasks for different repositories. The 
remote repositories are typically created to accommodate different 
tasks currently being performed in the project.
